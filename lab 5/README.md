## Lab 5: Programming ESP-8266

### Download Arduino IDE â€” https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
### Open Arduino IDE and then go to File -> Preference
### In  "Aditional Boards Manager URLs" add this line and click on "OK":
 "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json"

### Go to "Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager", type "ESP8266" and install it.

### Go again to "Tools -> Board" and select "Generic ESP8266 Module" or "Node MCU" whichever works for you.



## Now you should be able to write/flash code directly to your ESP-8266 (depends on if you have an interface to connect your ESP-8266 to your PC)
